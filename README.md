# Research-Proposal

Using smartphone to navigate inside a building with a most efficient route

Objectives:
1. Precise location of the user's position within an interior environment. Locate the floor and room the user is currently in.
2. Pathfinding within an interior environment. Users need to travel between different floors. The navigation system should be able to analyse room connection, location of elevator and staircases. Then calculate a shortest path then navigate users to their destination.
3. Display the AR navigation guidance on the smartphone for users.
